I've created a [Linux shell script](movilmax/) to automatically restart a 
Movilmax router (pictured above) when the Internet gateway is down. 
This script can be scheduled in your crontab.

I'm sharing this script here in case you're experiencing stability issues
with your WiMax signal and need a reliable solution to maintain your connection.
