# My Personal Collection

A cherry picked collection of personal code and guides.\
I hope you (and me) find them useful from time to time.\
For majority of them, there was no control versioning.

## Cherry Picked Materials

> Some of them are in Spanish, but Google Translate is your friend.

* [Applications](./apps/)
* [Code snippets and scripts](./scripts/)
* [Manual and step by step guides](./guides/)

## Independant Repositories

Anything that is not in this collection, is in a dedicated repository.\
The year below is the time when I started the project or was at its peak.
